This project is part of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Path.

The aim of this project is to create a responsive website using Flexbox. The design specifications are located within this repository for reference.

As a personal challenge, I have extended the responsiveness of this website to mobile devices using media queries. It should work well on most mobile phones and tablets.
